Hello! If you're here you got curious enough to check this code.

Some notes you should take while revising this code:
- If you're going to clone it and use it, use the "Production", since it's the most stable version of the site.
- If you're checking for security risks, check both Dev and Production, and, if found any, please, report by creating an issue at this github page.
- Dev will always be messy.
- Dev will always use the "https://localhost:8086" as it's link.

That's it, basically. Thanks!
